# PassGuard üõ°Ô∏è
Password manager built in Python.

![Example](resources/example.png)

## Installation üöÄ
To ensure PassGuard functions correctly, you might need to temporarily disable external antivirus software such as Avast. Follow these steps to install:

1. **Download the Repository**
   - You can either download the ZIP folder directly from GitHub or clone the repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/zaheyanez/passguard.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Root Directory**
   - Change to the root directory of the PassGuard project:
     ```bash
     cd passguard
     ```

3. **Run PassGuard**
   - For Windows:
     ```bash
     passguard.exe
     ```

## How It Works ‚ú®
PassGuard operates in such a way that, when you enter a label and click on generate, a name along with a password will be generated. This allows you to organize secure passwords for different social networks and applications. The password is stored encrypted, and generally, you shouldn't even need to see it. With just a click on "copy," you would be using your secure password without compromising it to people nearby. However, for greater flexibility, you still have the option to view the password.

I strongly advise against moving files or tinkering with directories if you don't know what you're doing, as this could cause a new encryption key to be created. This would prevent you from accessing previously saved passwords. Of course, this project is primarily about generating and storing secure passwords. Above all, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your accounts. This way, if you lose your password, it would be like a simple forgetfulness.

This project is solely for generating secure passwords that neither you nor I could remember, but which are ultimately secure.
